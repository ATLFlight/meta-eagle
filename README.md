# meta-eagle

The only way to get the firmware for the Eagle board is from the
BSP from Intrinsyc. The firmware is extracted from the cache.img
file for use in the Openembedded image.

The Intrinsyc EULA is in recipes-firmware/firmware/files/LICENSE

Install the required packages on the build machine:
```
sudo apt-get install e2tools android-tools-fsutils
```
